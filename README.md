### About The Project

In critical medical situations, the timely availability of blood is paramount, yet the process of finding and connecting with eligible donors is often fraught with delays and inefficiencies. This project tackles this critical challenge by creating a centralized, real-time digital platform that seamlessly connects blood donors, recipients, and blood banks.

Our mission is to build a life-saving digital ecosystem that bridges the dangerous gap between blood demand and supply. The platform moves beyond traditional methods by introducing an intelligent, automated, and location-aware system, ensuring that help is always just a notification away.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* **Intelligent Donor Matching:** Instantly matches patients with registered donors based on blood type, location, and availability.
* **Real-Time Emergency Alerts:** Hospitals and individuals can broadcast urgent blood requests, sending geo-targeted notifications to compatible donors.
* **Interactive Map View:** An integrated map interface to visualize nearby donors, blood drives, and registered blood banks.
* **Comprehensive Blood Bank Dashboard:** A dedicated portal for blood banks to manage their inventory, track blood types, and organize donation camps.
* **Secure User Profiles:** Donors can manage their profiles, view donation history, and receive eligibility reminders in a secure environment.
* **Community Engagement:** Fosters a sense of community by allowing users to share success stories and promote awareness.
